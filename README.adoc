{product-name} lets you add caching to your application without changing the code.

Implemented as a wrapper around your backend database's JDBC driver, {product-name} can cache
slow, repeated SQL queries in Redis, bypassing expensive database calls and greatly
improving response times.

== Table of Contents

== Background

Redis is an in-memory data store designed to serve data with the fastest possible response times.
For this reason, Redis is frequently used for caching.

It's not always easy to modify your code to utilize Redis as a cache.
You need to think about a number of issues, including:

* Result set serialization and deserialization
* Fault-tolerance
* Cache invalidation

This is why we built {product-name}.
After adding a single dependency and setting some basic configuration, your JDBC application can take advantage of Redis as a cache without any changes to your code.

image:redis-smart-cache-flow.png[]

== Quick start

To understand how {product-name} works, it's best to try it for yourself.

This example showcases an application that continuously performs queries against a MySQL database and uses {product-name} to cache query results.

First, clone this git repository:
[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
git clone {project-url}.git
cd {project-name}
----

Next, use Docker Compose to launch containers for MySQL, Grafana, Redis Stack, and a {product-name} example app instance:
[source,console]
----
docker compose up
----

// tag::demoSteps[]
Point your web browser to the http://localhost:3000/d/7B6csWTVk/redis-smart-cache?orgId=1&refresh=5s[Redis Smart Cache Grafana dashboard]. This is available through the Grafana instance running at https://localhost:3000.

Initially, no caching rules are active. You can see this in the *Query Mean Latency* metric (~2 s).

image:smart-cache-dashboard-no-caching.png[Dashboard without caching,width=1486]

To add a caching rule, start the Smart Cache CLI by opening a new terminal window and running `demo-cli`.

----
./demo-cli
----

Select *List application queries*:

image:cli-view-queries.png[View application queries,width=1486]

Then press *[Enter]* to select a query to cache:

image:cli-select-query.png[Select query,width=1486]

Once the query is displayed, enter a time-to-live (TTL) of 300s:

image:cli-set-ttl.png[Set TTL,width=1486]

To commit the new caching rule, press 'c'. Then follow the prompt to confirm the configuration change.

The application will immediately begin caching queries. You can observe this from the Smart Cache Grafana dashboard:

image:smart-cache-dashboard-with-caching.png[Dashboard with Caching,width=1486]

Important: If the Dashboard is not being populated, check your version of Grafana, earlier versions may have issues. When in doubt, peform a fresh pull of grafana by issuing "docker pull grafana/grafana" prior to bring the application up. Version 9.5.2, while 7.x showed the behavior this note was added for (lack of data on the dashboard). 

// end::demoSteps[]

== Installation

To use {product-name} with an existing application, you'll need to add the {product-name} JDBC driver as an application dependency.

.Maven
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>{project-group}</groupId>
    <artifactId>{artifact-id}</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

.Gradle
[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    implementation '{project-group}:{artifact-id}:{project-version}'
}
----

The next step is to configure {product-name}, as described below.

== Usage

First, ensure that your application is using {product-name} as its JDBC driver:

`com.redis.smartcache.Driver`

Next, set your JDBC URI to the URI of your Redis instance prefixed by `jdbc:` for example:
----
jdbc:redis://cache.redis.cloud:6379
----

See https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/wiki/Redis-URI-and-connection-details#uri-syntax[Lettuce's URI syntax] for all of the possible URI parameters you can use here.

Next step is providing bootstrap configuration which is done through JDBC properties.

=== Configuration

Refer to the <<property_types>> section below for details on different property types.

==== Application

===== `{property-prefix}.name`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>
* Default value: `{property-prefix}`

Name used to uniquely identify an application.
This is the prefix for all Redis keys used by {product-name}, such as cache entries, ruleset configuration, metrics, etc.

NOTE: This property should be the same across all instances of an application.

===== `{property-prefix}.query-cache-capacity`

* Type: <<property_type_integer>>
* Default value: `10000`

Capacity of the parsed query cache.

==== Driver

===== `{property-prefix}.driver.class-name`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>
* *Required*

Class name of the backend database JDBC driver, for example `oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver`.

===== `{property-prefix}.driver.url`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>
* *Required*

JDBC URL for the backend database, for example `jdbc:oracle:thin:@myhost:1521:orcl`.


===== Additional properties

You can also include any property your backend JDBC driver requires, like `username` or `password`.
These will be passed to the backend JDBC driver as is.

==== Redis

To further configure how {product-name} interacts with Redis, set the following properties:

===== `{property-prefix}.redis.key-separator`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>
* Default value: `:`

Delimiter to use between key elements.

===== `{property-prefix}.redis.cluster`

* Type: <<property_type_boolean>>
* Default value: `false`

Connect to a Redis Cluster.

===== `{property-prefix}.redis.tls`

* Type: <<property_type_boolean>>
* Default value: `false`

Establish a secure TLS connection.

===== `{property-prefix}.redis.tls-verify`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>
* Allowed values: `NONE`, `CA`, `FULL`
* Default value: `NONE`

TLS verification mode.
When set to `NONE`, no verification is performed.
In `CA` mode the Certificate Authority and certificate are verified but not that the hostname matches.
Use `FULL` mode for full certificate verification.

===== `{property-prefix}.redis.username`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>

Authenticate using the provided username.
Overrides username in Redis URI.
Requires password.

===== `{property-prefix}.redis.password`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>

Authenticate using the provided password.
Overrides password in Redis URI.

===== `{property-prefix}.redis.codec-buffer-capacity`

* Type: <<property_type_data_size>>
* Default value: `10MB`

Maximum capacity of the buffer used to encode a result set.

==== Metrics

===== `{property-prefix}.metrics.enabled`

* Type: <<property_type_boolean>>
* Default value: `true`

Enable publishing of metrics.

===== `{property-prefix}.metrics.registry`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>
* Allowed values: `REDIS`, `SIMPLE`, `JMX`
* Default value: `REDIS`

Meter registry type. Use `REDIS` for TimeSeries + RediSearch, `SIMPLE` for in-memory, `JMX` for JMX registry.

===== `{property-prefix}.metrics.step`

* Type: <<property_type_duration>>
* Default value: `60s`

Metrics publishing interval.

[[property_types]]
==== Property Types

{product-name} configuration properties support different value types.

[[property_type_boolean]]
===== `boolean`

The properties of type boolean support two values, `true` or `false`.

[[property_type_data_size]]
===== `data size`

The properties of type data size support values that describe an amount of data, measured in byte-based units.
These units are incremented in multiples of 1024, so one megabyte is 1024 kilobytes, one kilobyte is 1024 bytes, and so on.
For example, the value `6MB` describes six megabytes.

The data size type supports the following units:

* B: Bytes
* kB: Kilobytes
* MB: Megabytes
* GB: Gigabytes

[[property_type_duration]]
===== `duration`

The properties of type duration support values describing an amount of time, using the syntax of a non-negative number followed by a time unit.
For example, the value `7m` describes seven minutes.

The duration type supports the following units:

* ns: Nanoseconds
* us: Microseconds
* ms: Milliseconds
* s: Seconds
* m: Minutes
* h: Hours
* d: Days

A duration of 0 is treated as zero regardless of the unit that follows.
For example, 0s and 0m both mean the same thing.

Properties of type duration also support decimal values, such as `2.25d`.
These are handled as a fractional value of the specified unit.
For example, the value `1.5m` equals one and a half minutes, or 90 seconds.

[[property_type_integer]]
===== `integer`

The properties of type integer support whole numeric values, such as `5` and `1000`.
Negative values are supported as well, for example `-7`.
Integer type values must be whole numbers, decimal values such as 2.5 are not supported.

Some integer type properties enforce their own minimum and maximum values.

[[property_type_string]]
===== `string`

The properties of type string support a set of values that consist of a sequence of characters.
Allowed values are defined on a property-by-property basis, refer to the specific property for its supported and default values.

[[property_type_list]]
===== `list`

The properties of type list support a set of values consistent with how https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/reading-writing-java-properties-files-using-jackson-2-8-efd7a8da9d4c[Jackson properties] are serialized in an array with `field.position` e.g. if the first rule in the configuration was a tables-any "customers,orders" it would be serialized as something equivalent to:

[source]
----
1) 1) "1682625171488-0"
   2)  1) "rules.1.tables-any.1"
       2) "customers"
       3) "rules.1.tables-any.2"
       4) "orders"
----

=== Rules
{product-name} uses rules to determine how SQL queries are cached.
Rule configuration is stored in a Redis stream located at the key `{property-prefix}:config` and can be modified at runtime.
{product-name} will dynamically update to reflect configuration messages added to the stream. 

Here is the default rule configuration:
[source]
----
1) 1) "1682622362951-0"
   2)  1) "rules.1.ttl"
       2) "0s"
----

This default configuration contains a single passthrough rule (i.e. it applies to all SQL queries) with a TTL of 0 seconds, which means that no SQL results will be cached.

Rules are processed in order and consist of *criteria* (conditions) and *actions* (results).
Only the first rule with matching criteria will be considered, and its action applied.

==== Criteria

===== `tables`

* Type: <<property_type_list>>
* Example:
+
[source]
----
1) 1) "1682625092479-0"
   2)  1) "rules.1.ttl"
       2) "50m"
       3) "rules.1.tables.1"
       4) "products"
       5) "rules.1.tables.2"
       6) "customers"
       7) "rules.1.tables.3"
       8) "orders"
----

Triggers if the given tables are exactly the same as the list in the SQL query (order does not matter).

===== `tablesAny`

* Type: <<property_type_list>>
* Example:
+
[source]
----
1) 1) "1682625171488-0"
   2)  1) "rules.1.ttl"
       2) "50m"
       3) "rules.1.tables-any.1"
       4) "products"
       5) "rules.1.tables-any.2"
       6) "customers"
       7) "rules.1.tables-any.3"
       8) "orders"
----

Triggers if any of the given tables shows up in the SQL query.

===== `tablesAll`

* Type: <<property_type_list>>
* Example:
+
[source]
----
1) 1) "1682625239844-0"
   2)  1) "rules.1.ttl"
       2) "50m"
       3) "rules.1.tables-all.1"
       4) "products"
       5) "rules.1.tables-all.2"
       6) "customers"
       7) "rules.1.tables-all.3"
       8) "orders"
----

Triggers if all the given tables show up in the SQL query.

===== `queryIds`

* Type: <<property_type_list>>
* Example:
+
[source]
----
1) 1) "1682626067029-0"
   2) 1) "rules.1.ttl"
      2) "50m"
      3) "rules.1.query-ids.1"
      4) "5a934c95"
      5) "rules.1.query-ids.2"
      6) "beab0f6f"
----

Triggers if the SQL query ID matches any of the given IDs.

TIP: An ID is the CRC32 hash of the SQL query. You can use an online CRC32 calculator like https://randommer.io/Hash/CRC32[this one] to compute the ID.


===== `regex`

* Type: <<property_type_string>>
* Example:
+
[source]
----
1) 1) "1682626136637-0"
   2) 1) "rules.1.ttl"
      2) "50m"
      3) "rules.1.regex"
      4) "SELECT \\* FROM test\\.w*"
----

Triggers if given regular expression matches the SQL query.

TIP: It is a good idea to test regexes at https://regex101.com[regex101.com].

==== Action

===== `ttl`

* Type: <<property_type_duration>>
* Default value: `0s`
* Example:
+
[source]
----
1) 1) "1682626067029-0"
   2) 1) "rules.1.ttl"
      2) "50m"
----

Sets the time-to-live for the corresponding cache entry.

Use `0s` to disable caching.
